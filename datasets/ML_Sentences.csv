"What do I do? Machine learning, artificial intelligence and cybernetics."
"Imagine you have 100 red or blue points plotted on an X,Y graph; you want to make a function that separates the points into groups of only red and only blue."
"If your groups are completely distinct, you can split them with a linear line like y = m*x + b; anything above the line might be red, anything below might be blue."
"With machine learning, you would be trying multiple values of m and b in the equation, repeatedly looking for the values that separate the sets of red and blue points the best."
You can tell what's 'best' because you feed the training with lots of pre‑sorted information; you check what you have found as an equation with what the result actually is and repeat the process until you consistently achieve high accuracy on the known data.
"A full machine learning algorithm would do this for many different aspects it's trying to sort between, with a much more complex 'equation'."
"Essentially, yes. And the best part is that you can automate the grading and the tweaking."
"Programmers can train their program over several hours, letting it test, grade, tweak over and over thousands of times; it may start out with a 0% success rate but by the end it may be 80% accurate."
So like ‘pick red out of this spectrum’ and grade it until it keeps picking red all the time?
Machine learning is specific artificial intelligence.
"You can write a program to perform a task, then grade it on that task and adjust its settings based on its grade; do this over and over 1000 times and you will eventually have the settings just right to perform the task very well."

Machine learning tries to model real‑world data and optimize functions to minimize error.
"Machine learning is basically ‘here is a large set of data containing inputs and outputs, figure out what the relationship is for me’."
"If you have thousands of pictures of apples and thousands of pictures of things that aren't apples and train a machine learning model, it will learn to differentiate between them."
Classification asks: ‘Is this a picture of an apple or not?’.
"Regression asks: ‘Predict the value of this number, given previous values.’"
There are several types of machine learning; many of them are probability and statistics‑driven.
"You analyze large data sets, remember the probabilities of different occurrences under different conditions, and apply them to future data."
A baby learns what animals are by repetition; machine learning works similarly by exposure to labeled examples.
"TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras allow you to call mathematical operations on datasets like convolutions and normalizations."
"It's the difference between hard‑coding a solution yourself, or coding something that can change itself over time by observing data."
One way of doing this is to create a network of simulated neurons and feed that brain lots of data until it starts to learn the thing that you want it to learn.

"Machine learning can be seen as asking a question, getting an answer, judging it, adjusting, and repeating."
